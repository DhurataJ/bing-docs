# Bing News Search API endpoints


To get news search results using the Bing News Search API, send a `GET` request to one of the following endpoints. The headers and URL parameters define further specifications.

### News items by search query

```
GET https://api.bing.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/news/search
```

Returns news items based on a search query. If the search query is empty, the API will return top news articles from different categories. Send a query by url encoding your search term and appending it to the`q=""` parameter. For supported markets, see [Market codes](reference/market-codes.md).

### Top news items by category

```
GET https://api.bing.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/news  
```

Returns the top news items by category. You can specifically request the top business, sports, or entertainment articles using `category=business`, `category=sports`, or `category=entertainment`. Â The `category` parameter can only be used with the `/news` URL. There are some formal requirements for specifying categories; refer to [category](reference/query-parameters.md#category) documentation. Send a query by url encoding your search term and appending it to the`q=""` parameter. For supported markets, see [Market codes](reference/market-codes.md).

### Trending news topics 

```
GET https://api.bing.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/news/trendingtopics
```

Returns news topics that are currently trending on social networks. When the `/trendingtopics` option is included, Bing search ignores several other parameters, such as `freshness` and `?q=""`. For supported markets, see [Market codes](reference/market-codes.md).
