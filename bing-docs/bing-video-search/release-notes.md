# Release notes for Video Search APIs

See the following sections for information about changes that were included with each release.

## September 1, 2020

Initial release of this version of Bing Video Search APIs. These APIs replace the same APIs hosted by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-video-search/" target="_blank">Azure Cognitive Services</a>, which are being phased out. 

### New to Bing Search?

Go here to get a subscription key for the package that includes these APIs. Then, get familiar with the [Video Search API](bing-video-search/index.md) documentation, and be sure to check out the quickstarts to get up and running quickly.


### Current Cognitive Services user?

Things current Cognitive Services users must do prior to their subscription ending:

1. Update your application to use your Bing Search Services subscription key. Current Cognitive Services users that want to maintain continuity of service should sign up [here](???) for a Bing Search Services subscription before their Azure Cognitive Services subscription ends. 
  
2. Update your app to use the new endpoints. For the new endpoints, see:  
  
- [Web Search API](bing-web-search/reference/index.md)
- [Image Search API](bing-image-search/reference/index.md)
- [News Search API](bing-news-search/reference/index.md)
- [Video Search API](bing-video-search/reference/index.md)
- [Visual Search API](bing-visual-search/reference/index.md)
- [Autosuggest API](bing-autosuggest/reference/index.md)
- [Custom Search API](bing-custom-search/reference/index.md)
- [Spell Check API](bing-spell-check/reference/index.md)  

Unfortunately, if you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-web-search/bing-web-stats" target="_blank">Web Search Analytics</a>, your Cognitive Services metrics will not be used to seed Bing Search Services analytics.

If you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-local-business-search/local-search-reference" target="_blank">Local Business Search API</a>, it's not available in Bing Search Services.
