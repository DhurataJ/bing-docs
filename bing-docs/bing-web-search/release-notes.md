# Release notes

See the following sections for information about changes that were included with each release.

## September 1, 2020

Initial release of this version of Bing Search Services. These services replace the same services hosted by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-web-search/" target="_blank">Azure Cognitive Services</a>, which are being phased out. 

### New to Bing Search?

Go here to get a subscription key for the API package you want. Then, get familiar with the documentation for each of the APIs. Be sure to check out the quickstarts to get up and running quickly.

- [Web Search API](bing-web-search/index.md)
- [Image Search API](bing-image-search/index.md)
- [News Search API](bing-news-search/index.md)
- [Video Search API](bing-video-search/index.md)
- [Visual Search API](bing-visual-search/index.md)
- [Autosuggest API](bing-autosuggest/index.md)
- [Custom Search API](bing-custom-search/index.md)

### Current Cognitive Services user?

Things current Cognitive Services users must do prior to their subscription ending:

1. Update your application to use your Bing Search Services subscription key. Current Cognitive Services users that want to maintain continuity of service should sign up here for a Bing Search Services subscription before their Azure Cognitive Services subscription ends. 
  
2. Update your app to use the new endpoints. For the new endpoints, see:  
  
- [Web Search API](bing-web-search/reference/index.md)
- [Image Search API](bing-image-search/reference/index.md)
- [News Search API](bing-news-search/reference/index.md)
- [Video Search API](bing-video-search/reference/index.md)
- [Visual Search API](bing-visual-search/reference/index.md)
- [Autosuggest API](bing-autosuggest/reference/index.md)
- [Custom Search API](bing-custom-search/reference/index.md)
- [Spell Check API](bing-spell-check/reference/index.md)  

Unfortunately, if you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-web-search/bing-web-stats" target="_blank">Web Search Analytics</a>, your Cognitive Services metrics will not be used to seed Bing Search Services analytics.

If you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-local-business-search/local-search-reference" target="_blank">Local Business Search API</a>, it's not available in Bing Search Services.
