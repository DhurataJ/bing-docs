title: "What is the Bing Custom Autosuggest API?"
titleSuffix: Bing Services
description: The Bing Custom Autosuggest lets you send a partial search query term to Bing and get back a list of suggested queries that other users have searched on or that are based on user intent. Typically, you use this API to support a richer search box experience. For example, you'd call this API for each character the user enters and populate the search box's drop-down list with the suggested query strings.
