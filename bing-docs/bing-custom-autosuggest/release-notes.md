# Release notes for Custom Autosuggest API

See the following sections for information about changes that were included with each release.

## September 1, 2020

Initial release of this version of Bing Custom Autosuggest API. This API replaces the same API hosted by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-custom-autosuggest/" target="_blank">Azure Cognitive Services</a>, which is being phased out. 

### New to Bing Search?

Go here to get a subscription key for the package that includes this API. Then, get familiar with the [Custom Autosuggest API](overview.md) documentation, and be sure to check out the quickstarts to get up and running quickly.


### Current Cognitive Services user?

Things current Cognitive Services users must do prior to their subscription ending:

1. Update your application to use your Bing Search Services subscription key. Current Cognitive Services users that want to maintain continuity of service should sign up [here](???) for a Bing Search Services subscription before their Azure Cognitive Services subscription ends. 
  
2. Update your app to use the new endpoints. For the new endpoints, see [Custom Autosuggest API](reference/endpoints.md) reference.

Unfortunately, if you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-web-search/bing-web-stats" target="_blank">Web Search Analytics</a>, your Cognitive Services metrics will not be used to seed Bing Search Services analytics.

If you use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-local-business-search/local-search-reference" target="_blank">Local Business Search API</a>, it's not available in Bing Search Services.
