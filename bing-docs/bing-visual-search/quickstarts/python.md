# Quickstart: Get image insights using the Bing Visual Search REST API and Python

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Visual Search API. This Python application uploads an image to the API and displays the information it returns. Although this application is written in Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)

[!INCLUDE [bing-visual-search-signup-requirements](../../../includes/bing-visual-search-signup-requirements.md)]

## Initialize the application

1. Create a new Python file in your favorite IDE or editor, and add the following `import` statement:

    ```python
    import requests, json
    ```

2. Create variables for your subscription key, endpoint, and the path to the image you're uploading. 

    ```python

    BASE_URI = 'https://api.bing.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/images/visualsearch'
    SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = 'your-subscription-key'
    imagePath = 'your-image-path'
    ```
    
3. When you upload a local image, the form data must include the `Content-Disposition` header. Set its `name` parameter to "image", and set the `filename` parameter to the file name of your image. The contents of the form include the binary data of the image. The maximum image size you can upload is 1 MB.
    
    ```
    --boundary_1234-abcd
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="myimagefile.jpg"
    
    Ã¿Ã˜Ã¿Ã  JFIF Ã–Ã†68g-Â¤CWÅ¸Ã¾29ÃŒÃ„Ã¸Ã–â€˜ÂºÂ«â„¢Ã¦Â±Ã¨uZiÃ€)"Ã³Ã“ÃŸÂ°ÃŽ=Â Ã˜J9Ã¡+*GÂ¦...
    
    --boundary_1234-abcd--
    ```

4. Create a dictionary object to hold your request's header information. Bind your subscription key to the string `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`.

    ```python
    HEADERS = {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}
    ```

5. Create another dictionary to contain your image, which is opened and uploaded when you send the request.

    ```python
    file = {'image' : ('myfile', open(imagePath, 'rb'))}
    ```

## Parse the JSON response

Create a method called `print_json()` to accept the API response, and print the JSON.

```python
def print_json(obj):
    """Print the object as json"""
    print(json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True, indent=2, separators=(',', ': ')))
```

## Send the request

Use `requests.post()` to send a request to the Bing Visual Search API. Include the string for your endpoint, header, and file information. Print `response.json()` with `print_json()`.

```python
try:
    response = requests.post(BASE_URI, headers=HEADERS, files=file)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print_json(response.json())
    
except Exception as ex:
    raise ex
```
